# SimpleSprink
Simplified irrigation controlle

This is an irrigation controller like my earlier "SuperSprink". Why another? My watering system would sometimes fail when my MQTT server went off-line. The plants in my garden hated that. This controller is completely self contained in a esp8266 and does not require a MQTT server.
